Good nucleosomes are separated by 147 base pairs while fuzzy nucleosomes are 
randomly distributed. The variance is affecting the distribution of the reads 
associated to each nucleosome. The maximum coverage is applied to each 
nucleosome separatly. The offset affects the position of the first chromosome.
