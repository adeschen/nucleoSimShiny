A nucleosome consisting of a segment of DNA wound around eight 
histone proteins. It forms a structure of approximately 147 base pairs (bp) of 
DNA.

The positions of nucleosomes control local DNA accessibility. Thus, nucleosomes 
play a critical role in regulating the process of gene transcription. 

Several software, such as NORMAL (Polishko et al, 2012) and PING 
(Woo et al, 2013), have been developed to detect the position of 
the nucleosomes on the genome using paired-end reads. Synthetically generated 
nucleosome maps are useful tools to test the sensitivity and the accurancy of 
those software.

This application enables the generation of nucleosome maps through an
interactive interface.

First, the parameters must be set in the **Parameter** panel. Then, the 
nucleosome map can be visualized in the **Graph** panel. Finally, the
nucleosome dataset is available in the **Download** panel.
