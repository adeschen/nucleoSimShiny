Nucleosomes play a critical role in regulating the process of gene 
transcription. Several software have been developed to detect the position of 
the nucleosomes on the genome using paired-end reads. Simulated nucleosome 
samples are useful tools to test the sensitivity and the accurancy of 
those software.
